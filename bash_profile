# This file, .bash_profile, is executed for login shells.
# Mac OS X starts a login shell by default and executes .bash_profile each time.

# Uncomment the next the following for debugging with .bash_profile
# This file is loaded before .bashrc
# echo 'this is from .bash_profile'

# /usr/local and its subdirectories are used for the installation of software and
# other files for use on the local machine. What this really means is that software
# that is not part of the official distribution (which usually goes in /usr/bin) goes here.

# Basic setup
source ~/dotfiles/local/bash_profile_basic.sh

# Sourcing
# source ~/dotfiles/local/dot_test.sh
